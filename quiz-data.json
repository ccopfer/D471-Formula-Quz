    {
      "question": "A factory produces 500 units per week, and the average on-hand inventory is 2,000 units. What is the weeks of supply?",
      "choices": [
        "2 weeks",
        "3 weeks",
        "4 weeks",
        "5 weeks"
      ],
      "correct": "4 weeks",
      "explanation": "Weeks of supply estimates how long current inventory will last at the present usage rate. Formula: Weeks of supply = Average on-hand inventory \u00f7 Average weekly demand. Here: 2,000 \u00f7 500 = 4 weeks. This is a coverage metric that guides replenishment timing and safety stock policy."

    {
      "question": "A company ships goods 600 miles in a single truckload at a cost of $1,200, compared to two separate 300-mile shipments costing $900 each. Which concept explains the cost savings?",
      "choices": [
        "Economies of scope",
        "Economies of distance",
        "Economies of scale",
        "Learning curve effect"
      ],
      "correct": "Economies of distance",
      "explanation": "Economies of distance: the per-mile or per-unit cost declines when distance per shipment increases because fixed activities (dock time, paperwork, loading) are spread over more miles. One 600-mile run often costs less than two 300-mile runs."
    },
    {
      "question": "A firm has fixed costs of $50,000 and variable costs of $25 per unit. If 5,000 units are produced, what is the total cost?",
      "choices": [
        "$125,000",
        "$150,000",
        "$175,000",
        "$200,000"
      ],
      "correct": "$175,000",
      "explanation": "Total cost (TC) combines fixed costs (unchanged with volume) and variable costs (change with volume). TC = Fixed cost + (Variable cost \u00d7 Quantity) = 50,000 + (25 \u00d7 5,000) = 175,000. This is foundational to pricing and profitability analysis."
    },
    {
      "question": "A bakery sells cakes at $40 each. Fixed costs are $20,000, and variable costs are $10 per cake. What is the break-even quantity?",
      "choices": [
        "500 cakes",
        "600 cakes",
        "667 cakes",
        "800 cakes"
      ],
      "correct": "667 cakes",
      "explanation": "Break-even quantity (Q_BE) is the sales volume where profit is zero. Q_BE = Fixed cost \u00f7 (Price \u2212 Variable cost) = 20,000 \u00f7 (40 \u2212 10) = 666.7 \u2192 667 cakes. Beyond this point, each sale contributes to profit."

    {
      "question": "The total time to complete tasks is 150 seconds, and the cycle time is 30 seconds. What is the theoretical minimum number of workstations required?",
      "choices": [
        "3",
        "4",
        "5",
        "6"
      ],
      "correct": "5",
      "explanation": "Theoretical minimum workstations = Total task time \u00f7 Cycle time = 150 \u00f7 30 = 5. This lower bound helps assess how close a line balance is to ideal; real layouts may need more due to task precedence and indivisibilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Customer demand requires 12 units per hour. If takt time per unit is 5 minutes, what is the maximum production rate per hour?",
      "choices": [
        "10 units",
        "12 units",
        "15 units",
        "20 units"
      ],
      "correct": "12 units",
      "explanation": "Takt time matches production pace to demand: Takt = Available time \u00f7 Demand. If takt is 5 minutes/unit, then rate = 60 \u00f7 5 = 12 units/hour, ensuring supply matches the required demand cadence."
    },
    {
      "question": "The sales data for four months was: 20, 25, 30, 35. What is the forecast for month 5 using a 3-period moving average?",
      "choices": [
        "25",
        "27",
        "30",
        "33"
      ],
      "correct": "30",
      "explanation": "A simple moving average evens out random noise by averaging recent periods. Use the most recent 3 periods: (25 + 30 + 35) \u00f7 3 = 30. This method is easy to compute but can lag turning points."
    },
    {
      "question": "Using simple exponential smoothing with \u03b1 = 0.2, the previous forecast was 500 units and actual demand was 600 units. What is the new forecast?",
      "choices": [
        "500",
        "520",
        "540",
        "560"
      ],
      "correct": "520",
      "explanation": "Exponential smoothing updates the forecast by a fraction (\u03b1) of the error: New = Old + \u03b1 \u00d7 (Actual \u2212 Old) = 500 + 0.2 \u00d7 (600 \u2212 500) = 520. Lower \u03b1 yields stability; higher \u03b1 increases responsiveness."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a trend-adjusted forecast has an unadjusted forecast of 1,200 units and a trend factor of 100, what is the adjusted forecast?",
      "choices": [
        "1100 units",
        "1200 units",
        "1300 units",
        "1400 units"
      ],
      "correct": "1300 units",
      "explanation": "Trend-adjusted (Holt) smoothing adds a trend component to the base forecast: Adjusted = Base + Trend = 1,200 + 100 = 1,300. This compensates for persistent upward or downward movement."
    },
    {
      "question": "A simple linear regression has slope = 8 and intercept = 200. If x = 50, what is the forecasted value?",
      "choices": [
        "400",
        "600",
        "2000",
        "2600"
      ],
      "correct": "600",
      "explanation": "Simple regression estimates Y from one predictor X: Y\u0302 = a + bX. Here a = 200, b = 8, X = 50 \u2192 Y\u0302 = 200 + 8\u00d750 = 600. Useful when a single driver explains demand well."
    },
    {
      "question": "A multiple regression forecast has intercept = 300, slope1 = 5 (x1 = 100), and slope2 = 2 (x2 = 50). What is the forecast?",
      "choices": [
        "800",
        "900",
        "1000",
        "1100"
      ],
      "correct": "900",
      "explanation": "Multiple regression uses several predictors: Y\u0302 = a + b1x1 + b2x2. Compute: 300 + 5\u00d7100 + 2\u00d750 = 300 + 500 + 100 = 900. Adding relevant predictors can improve accuracy."
    },
    {
      "question": "Annual demand is 10,000 units, ordering cost is $50 per order, and holding cost is $5 per unit per year. What is the EOQ?",
      "choices": [
        "200 units",
        "316 units",
        "400 units",
        "447 units"
      ],
      "correct": "447 units",
      "explanation": "Economic Order Quantity minimizes the sum of ordering and holding costs: EOQ = \u221a((2DS)/H). Substitute: \u221a((2\u00d710,000\u00d750)/5) = \u221a(200,000) \u2248 447 units. Ordering at EOQ balances order frequency and inventory size."
    },
    {
      "question": "In a fixed-time-period inventory system, if order quantity is 1,000 units and demand rate is 200 units per week, what is the order interval?",
      "choices": [
        "2 weeks",
        "3 weeks",
        "4 weeks",
        "5 weeks"
      ],
      "correct": "5 weeks",
      "explanation": "Order interval (time between orders) = Order quantity \u00f7 Demand rate = 1,000 \u00f7 200 = 5 weeks. This approach places orders at regular time gaps sized to expected demand."
    },
    {
      "question": "If a company has an average on-hand inventory of 500 units and uses 250 units weekly, what is the weeks of supply?",
      "choices": [
        "1 week",
        "2 weeks",
        "3 weeks",
        "4 weeks"
      ],
      "correct": "2 weeks",
      "explanation": "Weeks of supply = Inventory \u00f7 Weekly usage = 500 \u00f7 250 = 2 weeks. This indicates how long current stock covers demand before replenishment is needed."
    },
    {
      "question": "A logistics firm moves freight 200 miles for $700 or 400 miles for $1,000. Which principle applies?",
      "choices": [
        "Economies of motion",
        "Economies of distance",
        "Diseconomies of scale",
        "Experience curve"
      ],
      "correct": "Economies of distance",
      "explanation": "The average cost per mile falls as distance increases: 700/200 = $3.50/mi vs 1,000/400 = $2.50/mi. This cost behavior exemplifies economies of distance in transportation."
    },
    {
      "question": "A production line has tasks totaling 180 seconds, with a cycle time of 45 seconds. What is the minimum number of workstations?",
      "choices": [
        "3",
        "4",
        "5",
        "6"
      ],
      "correct": "4",
      "explanation": "Theoretical minimum workstations = Total task time \u00f7 Cycle time = 180 \u00f7 45 = 4. Use this as a benchmark when line balancing to identify idle time and bottlenecks."
    },
    {
      "question": "A company\u2019s fixed cost is $40,000, variable cost per unit is $20, and selling price per unit is $60. What is the break-even quantity?",

        "200",
        "225",
        "250",
        "300"
      ],
      "correct": "250",
